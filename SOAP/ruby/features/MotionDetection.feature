Feature: Motion Detection
  In order to configure motion detection
  As an API client
  I want to use the motion detection services

  Scenario Outline: Setup two motion detection regions
    Given I have region <input_1> into the calculator
    And I have entered <input_2> into the calculator
    When I press <button>
    Then the result should be <output> on the screen

  Examples:
    | input_1 | input_2 | button | output |
    | 20      | 30      | add    | 50     |
    | 2       | 5       | add    | 7      |
    | 0       | 40      | add    | 40     |
